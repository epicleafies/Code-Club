        <h1>The History</h1>
        <p>
            We founded Code Club two years ago in an effort to teach high school and above computer science principles to people of all ages. As two young people interested in computer science and pursuing computer science based fields, we have long been on the lookout for a program that would teach us the things we needed to know simply and without hassle. There are plenty of standard computer science programs but too many rely on simplistic methods like drag and drop code, when people really just want to learn practical skills. So after we went through the painstaking process of teaching ourselves a couple coding languages and working out the kinks of our teaching style, we created Code Club.
            Here at Code Club, It’s not our job to inspire you, you wouldn’t come to our website if you weren’t. We’re here to teach you the code and let your creativity and ambition guide you to do with these skills what you will.
